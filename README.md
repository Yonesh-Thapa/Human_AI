# Symbolic AI Genesis

This project explores building a lightweight symbolic AI that learns letters,
sounds, and simple meanings without large pretrained datasets. The code is
split across the `symbolic_ai` package with modules for vision, audio, web
scraping, cognition, creativity and supporting tools.

Run the full test suite with:

```bash
python3 -m symbolic_ai.tests.test_all
```

The tests exercise the small but working functionality implemented in each
module.
