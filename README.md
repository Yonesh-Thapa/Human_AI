# Symbolic AI Genesis

This project explores building a lightweight symbolic AI that learns letters, sounds, and meanings without large pretrained datasets. The structure is organized in the `symbolic_ai` package with modules for vision, audio, web scraping, cognition, creativity, and tools. Each module includes minimal placeholder implementations and tests to ensure the framework runs.
